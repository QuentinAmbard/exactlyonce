  //REQUIREMENT:
  // Master election.
  // No more than 1 node can flag itself as master at the same time.
  // "Master priority": there is a priority for a node to be master: 1,2,3,4 => if master 1 dies, node 2 must be the next elected master (not 3 as long as 2 is alive)
  // Short election time (first test at 5 sec)
  // Possibility to force a node to become master.

  //NOTES:
  //Exception type not properly handled
  //Use prepared statement everywhere
  //request at CL=QUORUM
  //LTW with CL = SERIALIZABLE
  //TODO speculative retry? We need to check the response time of a LWT with iter-DC latencies to make sure the 500ms timeout is also fine.
    If not, we'll have to create a separate profile for LWT queries with different speculative retry config.

  //TABLES:
  CREATE TABLE masters (
      type text PRIMARY KEY,
      active boolean,
      node_id int,
      time timestamp
  ) WITH default_time_to_live = 5
